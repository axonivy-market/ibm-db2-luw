# MY-PRODUCT-NAME

Provides the IBM Db2 LUW (Linux, Unix and Windows) JDBC Driver

## Demo

The demo showcases three simple processes: The first creates a table in the Db2 database, the second inserts data into it, and the third retrieves the data.

## Setup

On a command line `cd ibm-db2-luw-connector-demo` and execute `docker compose up`.
This will start a IBM Db2 LUW database in a docker container.
It takes a few minutes before the database is ready.
